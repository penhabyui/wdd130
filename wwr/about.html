            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Rapids embarked on its journey in 2015, born from a shared love for adventure and Brazil's breathtaking landscapes. 
            Founded by Bruno de Luca Penha and a team of passionate explorers, Rapids started with humble beginnings, offering guided rafting trips on local rivers.
            By 2019, our commitment to safety and excellence earned us recognition as a leading provider of thrilling outdoor experiences. 
            In 2022, we expanded our operations to include more rivers across Brazil, catering to adventurers of all ages and skill levels. 
            Today, Rapids continues to grow, offering unforgettable rafting adventures that blend adrenaline, nature, and lasting memories.</p>
